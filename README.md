Hexen - Rebirth of Cronos is a Modding Project by Emmanuel Frechou (Project Leader) which will be available in GZDoom, created by a Team of capable Developers such as Grigoriy (3D Designer/Modeller) and DaXx (3D Modeller, VFX Artist, Coder, Level Designer) in GZDoom.

This customized build of Hexen Rebirth of Cronos mod aims to split the mod into parts to customize the load orders. It also contains fixes for LZDoom/QuestZDoom ports (and has separated PBR patch for the reason)
